HTML the Right Way
 Estimated Time: 5-6 hours
In the previous lesson, we practiced using HTML, but we deliberately held off on providing much in the way of "theory." In this lesson, we'll go deeper into HTML.

First, we'll go over the terminology and background knowledge you need to competently talk about HTML. We'll discuss the difference between tags, elements, and attributes, what is meant when people say HTML is about "structure" (vs. style or behavior), and weâ€™ll learn to write semantic HTML.

In the second assignment, you'll complete a series of short drills to practice HTML.

Next, we'll take our first look at Google Chrome Developer Tools, which you can use to inspect and modify the HTML on any site. See a feature on a site you like, and wondering how it's implemented? Developer Tools makes this (and much more) possible.

Finally, we'll close out this lesson with a challenge where you create an online resume for a fictional person (Sally Student is back!), using semantic HTML.

By the end of this lesson, you'll have a solid conceptual grasp of HTML. You'll be able to speak knowledgeably about it in interviews, and you'll know how to structure your content into a well formed HTML document.
