Frontend Web Development
 Estimated Time: 96-100 hours
Welcome to Introduction to Frontend Web Development. This course teaches you the fundamentals of modern frontend web development. You'll learn how to use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create thoughtfully designed, cleanly implemented web applications. Along the way, you'll learn about rapid prototyping (where you quickly build a minimal version of an app to get in front of users ASAP), using the command line, using Git and GitHub, and jQuery.
Whether your next step is deeper study of software engineering or you're a terminal student, this course teaches you everything you need to know in order to become a competent, intermediate frontend web developer.
In unit 1, you'll learn about HTML and CSS, which are the languages used to describe the structure and style of a page, respectively.
In unit 2, you'll learn programming fundamentals in JavaScript.
In unit 3, you'll learn about jQuery and complete your capstone project for this course.
Let's get started!

HTML, CSS, and Version Control
 Estimated Time: 29-33 hours
In this unit, you'll get up to speed on three key technologies:
HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language), which is the language used to describe the structure of a webpage.
CSS (Cascading Style Sheets), which is the language used to describe the appearance of a webpage.
Git and GitHub. Git is a system for version control, which is a way of backing up and managing changes to code. Git lives on your local computer, and you use it to run version control commands. GitHub is a cloud-based platform for storing and collaborating on projects that use Git.
The ultimate goal of this unit is for you to feel comfortable coding up a webpage from designs. By the end, you'll know how to create, publish, and backup basic web pages, and you'll have the right vocabulary to discuss HTML, CSS, and version control with others.
This unit is divided into seven lessons. Here's what we'll cover:
In Lesson 1: Web page basics, you'll take your first steps with HTML and CSS as we rapidly build and publish an "About me" page. The aim of this lesson is to rev up and shallowly touch on all the ideas that we'll go into depth on in the rest of the unit.
In Lesson 2: HTML the Right Way, you'll learn the concepts and vocabulary you need to know in order to reason about, discuss, and effectively write HTML.
In Lesson 3: CSS the Right Way, you'll learn the concepts and vocabulary you need to know in order to reason about, discuss, and effectively write CSS.
In Lesson 4: Version control with Git and GitHub, we'll do a deep dive on version control. Version control has to do with how we manage changes to software. We'll teach you about the command line so you can use Git command line (which is how most professional engineers handle version control), and you'll learn about how Git and GitHub fit into collaborative, real-world workflows.
In Lesson 5: CSS Layouts, you'll learn about the hardest part of CSS: layouts.
In Lesson 6: Forms and Inputs, you'll learn about working with forms in HTML and CSS.
Finally, in Lesson 7: Responsive Design Basics, you'll get up to speed on creating websites that look good across devices, whether your user's screen is two or twenty inches wide.
